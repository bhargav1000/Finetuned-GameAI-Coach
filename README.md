- **Debug Tools**: Real-time Q-value visualization and combat statistics

## Game Components

### AI System
- **Q-Learning Agents**: Both knights use reinforcement learning to improve combat performance

- **Dynamic Action Selection**: Context-aware decision making based on distance, health, and opponent state
- **Configurable Parameters**: JSON-based learning rate, epsilon decay, and reward tuning

### Combat Mechanics
- **Multi-layered Attack System**: Melee, special attacks, kicks with wind-up and hit detection
- **Directional Blocking**: 120-degree frontal arc blocking with stamina costs
- **Armor & Durability**: Helmet, breastplate, greaves with damage-over-time degradation
- **Health & Stamina**: Resource management affecting combat capabilities

### Technical Features
- **Anti-Push Physics**: Robust collision system preventing character displacement
- **Predictive Movement**: Future position calculation to prevent physics exploits
- **Animation Consistency**: Global timing control without frame-rate overrides
- **Data Persistence**: Q-table saving/loading for continuous learning

## Prerequisites

To run this game, you will need a modern web browser and a way to serve the files locally. You'll also need to run the optional backend for data collection.

## Quick Start

### 1. Frontend Setup (Required)

**Option A: Using npm (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

**Option B: Using npx**
```bash
npx http-server
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

**Option C: Using Python**
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Backend Setup (Optional - for data collection)

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the AI bridge server:
```bash
python game_event_microservice/ai_bridge_fastapi.py
```

The backend runs on `http://localhost:8765` and provides:
- Screenshot capture and storage
- Game event logging to ChromaDB
- Semantic search capabilities for game analysis

### 3. Training Data Generation (Optional - for AI assistant development)

Generate comprehensive training datasets from collected gameplay data:
```bash
python generate_training_data.py
```

This creates:
- **11,741+ training examples** in instruction-following format
- **Tactical analysis** for each game state
- **Strategic recommendations** based on historical win/loss patterns
- **Model-ready datasets** for fine-tuning AI assistants

## Game Interface

### AI-Controlled Combat
The game runs **completely autonomously** - both knights are controlled by AI agents that learn and adapt their fighting strategies in real-time. No manual input is required for gameplay.

### Debug Controls
- **X**: Toggle collision boundary visualization
- **F2**: Toggle physics body debug display
- **P**: Manual screenshot capture

### Debug Panels
- **Q-Learning Panel** (right side): Real-time Q-values for knight actions
- **Events Panel** (bottom): Live combat event log
- **Health/Stamina Bars**: Visual representation of knight status

## AI Configuration

### Learning Parameters
Modify `heroknight.json` and `pknight.json` to adjust:
- **learningRate**: How quickly AI adapts (0.05-0.1)
- **discountFactor**: Future reward importance (0.9)
- **epsilonStart/Min**: Exploration vs exploitation balance
- **decaySteps**: Learning progression rate

### Combat Behavior
The AI system includes:
- **Distance-based decision making**: Different strategies for close/medium/far combat
- **Aggressive bias**: Heavy penalties for passive behavior
- **Contextual rewards**: Bonuses for situationally appropriate actions
- **Continuous learning**: Q-tables persist between sessions

## Research Applications

This project demonstrates:
- **Multi-agent reinforcement learning** in competitive environments
- **Real-time learning** with immediate strategy adaptation
- **Behavioral analysis** through comprehensive data collection
- **Physics-based AI** with realistic movement and collision constraints
- **AI assistant training** using gameplay data for strategic coaching models

## Training Data Features

### Generated Dataset Statistics
- **11,741 training examples** from 134 game sessions

### AI Assistant Training Format
Each training example includes:
```json
{
  "instruction": "You are an expert fighting game coach. Analyze this game state and provide tactical advice for the hero player.",
  "input": "Hero: 73% HP, 69% stamina, unsheath-s. Knight: 0% HP, 24% stamina, die. Distance: close, Phase: game_over",
  "output": "You have a significant health advantage! Control the pace"
}
```

### Model Compatibility
The training dataset is optimized for fine-tuning:
- **Phi-3.5 Mini Instruct** (3.8B parameters)
- **Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** (8B parameters)
