# Debugging and Development Tools

## Debug Controls

### Physics Visualization
- **F2 Key**: Toggle Matter.js physics body visibility for walls and static objects
- **X Key**: Toggle custom debug shapes (boundaries, collision circles)

### Visual Debug Elements
- **Red Lines**: Arena boundaries and walls
- **Blue/Green Circles**: Character collision areas and sensors
- **No Yellow Boxes**: Attack sensor visualization removed to prevent combat distraction

## Debug Information

### Performance Monitoring
- Frame rate display in development mode
- Physics step timing
- Animation frame tracking

### AI State Visualization
- Q-value displays for both agents
- Action selection reasoning
- State bin calculations (distance, health, actions)

### Combat Analysis
- Hit detection sensor creation/destruction
- Damage calculation breakdown
- Blocking angle calculations
- Stamina consumption tracking

## Development Guidelines

### Debug Mode Safety
- All debug visualizations should be toggleable
- Performance impact minimized in production
- Debug overlays don't interfere with gameplay
- Clear visual distinction between debug and game elements

### Testing Features
- Character position reset capabilities
- AI behavior forcing for testing
- Manual state manipulation for edge case testing
- Replay system for combat analysis
