## Development Guidelines

### Demo.js Modifications
- **Keep main.js untouched** - Always reference but never modify
- **AI Integration Points**: 
  - `requestAISuggestion()` - Manual suggestion requests
  - `updateDemoInterface()` - Live UI updates inside game window
  - `getCurrentGameStateString()` - State serialization for model input
- **Demo-Specific Features**:
  - **User Control**: Player controls hero via keyboard/Xbox controller
  - **AI-Only Purple Knight**: Purple Knight remains AI-controlled but Q-learning disabled
  - **Preserved Learning**: Purple Knight's Q-table remains unchanged during demo

### AI Model Server (ai_model_server.py)
- **Port**: 8766 (separate from data bridge)
- **Input**: Game state string with health, stamina, distance, phase
- **Model**: Fine-tuned Phi-3.5-mini-instruct for tactical advice
- **Fallback**: Rule-based suggestions when model unavailable
- **Device Detection**: Auto-detects CUDA/MPS/CPU

### Data Collection Bridge (ai_bridge_fastapi.py)
- **Port**: 8765 (data collection only)
- **Purpose**: Screenshots, ChromaDB, training data
- **No AI suggestions** - purely for data collection

### Interface Updates
- **Integrated Panel**: AI suggestions inside game window, replacing Q-Learning debug
- **Real-time State**: Health, stamina, distance, phase tracking in compact format
- **Suggestion Display**: Current advice in highlighted box with confidence
- **Control Integration**: Simple get suggestion and auto-mode toggle buttons

## Testing Protocol

### Basic Demo Testing
1. **Start AI Model Server**: `python ai_model_server.py`
2. **Check Model Loading**: Verify fine-tuned model loads or fallback activates
3. **Demo Launch**: `npm run demo` (new terminal)
4. **Interface Check**: Verify AI panel appears inside game window (right side)
5. **User Controls**: Test keyboard/Xbox controller input for hero movement and combat
6. **AI Opponent**: Verify Purple Knight AI behavior without Q-learning updates
7. **AI Suggestions**: Test both manual "Get Suggestion" and auto modes
8. **Model Verification**: Check if using fine-tuned vs rule-based in panel
9. **Original Preservation**: Verify `npm run dev` still works
10. **Optional Data Collection**: Add `python game_event_microservice/ai_bridge_fastapi.py`

### Complete System Verification (1-1 Mapping)
11. **Movement Speed**: Verify both characters move at same speed (5 units)
12. **Anti-Push System**: Test character collision prevention (85px separation)
13. **Attack System**: Verify complete attack flow (wind-up → glow → sensor → damage)
14. **Damage Calculation**: Test armor modifiers and critical hits
15. **Stun Lock Prevention**: Verify 500ms grace period prevents rapid damage
16. **Stamina System**: Test exhaustion, regeneration delays, and disable timers
17. **Blocking System**: Verify directional blocking and stamina costs
18. **Death Handling**: Test complete death sequence and game over screen
19. **Error Prevention**: Ensure no "function not found" errors in console
20. **State Management**: Verify proper character state transitions

## Integration Notes

### Fine-tuned Model Integration
- **Automatic Detection**: Looks for `model/fine_tuned/` directory

### Common Issues
- **AI Model Offline**: Suggestions fall back to rule-based system automatically
- **Port 8766 in Use**: AI model server port conflict
- **Model Loading Failed**: Check `model/fine_tuned/` directory exists
- **CORS Errors**: Both servers (8765, 8766) have CORS enabled
- **Interface Not Loading**: Verify demo.html connects to port 8766

### Network Architecture (Unified)
- **Port 8766**: AI model server (`ai_model_server.py`) - **ALL DEMO ENDPOINTS**
  - `/ai_suggestion` - Tactical advice generation
  - `/game_event` - Game event logging
  - `/game_state_snapshot` - Screenshot capture  
  - `/model_info` - Model status
- **Port 8765**: Data collection bridge (`ai_bridge_fastapi.py`) - **OPTIONAL**
  - Only needed for ChromaDB data collection
  - Not required for demo functionality

### Debug Tools
- **Browser Console**: JavaScript errors and network requests
- **Data Bridge Terminal** (8765): Data collection logs
- **AI Model Terminal** (8766): Model inference logs and fallback status
- **Network Tab**: Check requests to both 8765 (data) and 8766 (AI)
- **Game Debug Keys**: (F2, X) still functional in demo
- **Model Info Endpoint**: `GET http://localhost:8766/model_info`
